Dear $name,													$date

Thank you for the $present. I really like it. I can't believe I'm
already $age years old, but it doesn't feel that much different
than being $age-1. I hope that sometime in the next year we can 
come visit you in $city.

Thank you again for the $present.

Sincereley,
$yourName
