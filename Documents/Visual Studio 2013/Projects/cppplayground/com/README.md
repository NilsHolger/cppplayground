Component Object Model is a binary interface introduced in 1993 to enable inter-process communication and dynamic object creation.
The essence is a language-neutral way of implementing objects that can be used in environments different from the one 
in which they were created, even across machine boundaries. Component implementers provide well defined interfaces that
are separated from the implementation. It was sought to be a better design of standard C++.
